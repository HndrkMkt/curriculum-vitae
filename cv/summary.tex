CS student at Technical University Berlin redesigning message brokers for modern hardware with the Data Engineering Systems group at Hasso Plattner Institute. I have several years of experience in data engineering and building data systems as well as machine learning. That practical knowledge is paired with a solid understanding of state-of-the-art research in data systems and causal learning theory through my work as a student researcher.  I am interested in building scalable data products and the intersection between machine learning and data systems. With an additional background in entrepreneurship and business management, I do not only solve interesting technical problems but take ownership of the systems I built with the business goals in mind. I am always up for a challenge and looking for a place to grow and learn new skills.
