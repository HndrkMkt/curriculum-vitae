I am a data and software engineer building systems at the intersection of large-scale data management and machine learning. 
I have several years of practical experience in designing and building data platforms, data processing pipelines, and applications on top of those. 
I have trained and mentored new employees for the data teams of multiple startups and enabled them to take ownership of their data infrastructure.
This is combined with academic and research experience in large-scale data processing and machine learning from my M.Sc. in Computer Science and award-winning work on message brokers on modern hardware as a student researcher.
Thanks to my additional background in entrepreneurship and business management, I do not only solve technical problems but take ownership of the systems I built with the business goals in mind.
